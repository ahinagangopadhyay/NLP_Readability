ðŸ“˜ NLP: Readability
Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. In natural language, the readability of text depends on its content â€” specifically, the complexity of its vocabulary and syntax.

It focuses on:

The words we choose

How we structure them into sentences and paragraphs

How easily readers can comprehend the message
